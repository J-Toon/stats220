## Repo Showcase

### I'll be using the skills I learned in stats220 so far to decorate this repository.

On this repository there will a html file containing:
1. A meme
2. A animated GIF

**Below I'll showcase my skills by showing an image, using unorded bullet points and creating a link.**

Above is my cat Barney

**I have three cats and their names are:**
* *Barney*
* *Willow*
* *Perry*

*Here's a link to the [SPCA](https://www.spca.nz/) website if you want to apodt a cat*
